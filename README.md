If you are skilled at Firefox extension development and want to contribute code for a bug fix or a new feature, follow these instructions:

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/aecreations/readnext/issues/new) to describe your bug fix or feature.
2. Create a new branch originating from the branch for the current major version, `branches/1.0`.  The new branch is where you should commit your code changes.
3. When your code changes are ready for review, open a pull request to merge to the branch for the current major version.
4. **IMPORTANT!**  The `main` branch contains the source code for the current release.  Do not commit directly to the `main` branch.
